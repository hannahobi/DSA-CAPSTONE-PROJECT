based on my findings, Express Air is used for high priority orders, medium and especially low priority orders which raises concerns about the shipping cost efficiency.
##### I will recommend:
* Restriction of Air Express to only High Priority shipments
* Use Truck Delivery for low and meduim priority to reduce cost
* Monitor monthly shipping to improve policy enforcement


#### As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I analyzed deep-dive SQL analysis across customers_segments, product_categories, and shipping methods. i performed my analysis with SQL Server, wrote queries and exported insights to Excel for review.
